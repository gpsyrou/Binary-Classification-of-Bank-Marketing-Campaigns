    "Purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset containing information about marketing campaigns that were conducted via phone calls from a Portuguese banking institution to their clients. Main goal of these campaigns was to attempt and persuade their clients to subscribe to a specific product (bank term deposit). At the end of each call the client was either ended up subscibing to the product (successful campaing) or not (unsuccessful campaing). The dataset contains 21 features (columns) and 41188 instances of calls to clients (rows). Please note that there are cases where the same client was contacted multiple times - something that practically doesn't affect our analysis as each call is being considered indipendent from another. If a client has been contacted multiple times is being captured in the features, as presented below:"

    "\n",

    "    b. **month**: last contact month of year <br>\n",
    "    c. **day_of_week**: last contact day of the week <br>\n",

    "    <br>\n",
    "3. Other features related to the campaign(s):\n",
    "    a. **campaign**: # of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client <br>\n",
    "    b. **pdays**: # of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign <br>\n",
